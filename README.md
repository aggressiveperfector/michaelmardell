*Alpha stage* 

**4 for 4**

 Updating my old Graphic Design website. Wanted to push out something reasonably quickly as a gauge for project completion time. I gave myself 4 hours a day for 4 days, aiming to complete concept development -> alpha build. Will be revisting some things  as well as expanding the scope when I have more projects completed. 

 Really enjoyed the challenge of such a fast paced project and it was refreshing to get something completed. I followed a conventional development process by segmenting and completing goals, in hopes of imitating in-house work or contract based projects.
