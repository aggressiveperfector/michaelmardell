        <p class="print-copy">Aggressive Perfector wanted to redefine the stereotypical corporate style for their branding and stationery. A double edged approach was taken for the design, focusing on the differences. The ink-blot style finishing of the very corporate silhouettes portrays this while still maintaining the professional feel. The typographic solution to the already very recognizable letterhead gives it just enough edge while still being interesting.</p>

        </div><!-- /print section -->
        <p class="print-copy">For ATypI’s conference in St. Petersburg, Russia, the focus was “the old & the new.” Drastically contrasting design approaches were taken to unify these two opposite aspects of the theme. The first being a classic take on the constructivism era that popularized Russian poster art. Angular, wedge style typography with little to no imagery. The second, focusing on the now and beyond, lends itself to the always futuristic space feel and treatment. These themes, both commonly associated with Russia used a modern colour pallet to revitalize the design and make it pop in public. </p>

        <p class="print-copy">For the Canadian Water and Wastewater Association, the focus on specific aspects of the trouble some residents of Canada are facing when dealing with clean, potable water at home. Using the already powerful imagery consistent with First Nations art, the figures are delivered in graph form, representing the shocking statistics the First  Nations people are forced to live with on reservations. Through powerful text and simple colour combinations, the message is delivered while encouraging the reader to get involved.</p>

        </div><!-- /print section -->
        <p class="print-copy">For the Loose Moose Vancouver’s menu redesign, a classier and more modern approach was taken to overtake their traditionally gritty feeling. While focusing on typography and details, the result is a simplistic, refreshing read, while keeping the reader interested and entertained. This combined with daily specials taking their names directly from popular rock song titles surprise the reader and make deciding what to eat a bit more fun.</p>

        </div><!-- /print section -->
        <p class="print-copy">The Crooks publication focuses on heavy metal music, from every aspect of the genre. The challenge here was to refresh the already overdone heavy metal sub texts that are apparent in most of today’s publications. Black and white images, a heavy use of white space and just the right amount of typographic details make this an interesting read. The serif and sans-serif combinations effectively lighten it up for a more contemporary crowd.</p>

        </div><!-- /print section -->
        <p class="print-copy">For Grouse Mountain's outdoor advertising campaign, a very specific and targeted approach was taken. Playing on the close proximity to Vancouver as the main selling point for the resort, it was decided to associate this with peoples relationships - specifically dating. Juxtaposed against this is our customer - the alpine enthusiast, who has been stood up for his date, accompanied by the tag line. This effectively portrays the benefits of a mountain resort close by as well as the negative repercussions of a resort too far away.</p>

        </div><!-- /print section -->
        <p class="print-copy">A fun side project I worked on doing some product photography. Using a lightbox with a few light sources/gels/filters. This was really enjoyable and it was a huge wake up call to the work that goes into professional grade photography. Starting with 100 photos and narrowing it down to just 2 or 3 was a cool experience.</p>
